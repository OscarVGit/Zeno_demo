Example
Question:
List the vehicle vin and make for all vehicles which were manufactured in the year 2021.
Answer:
R = π veh_vin, veh_make (σ veh_year= ''2021" VEHICLE)
OR
R1 = σ veh_year= ''2021" VEHICLE
R = π veh_vin, veh_make (R1)
a.	List the part code, part description for all parts supplied by the vendor named "Supercheap Auto".

( σ vendor_id = ( π vendor_id ( σ vendor_name = 'Supercheap Auto' (VENDOR) 
)
 ) (PART)
